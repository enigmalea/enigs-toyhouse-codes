# Enig's Toyhouse Codes
My codes and styles for [Toyhou.se](https://toyhou.se/). Free to use, distribute, alter, or do whatever you want with them.

I don't know how much coding I'll actually do for Toyhouse, but any codes I do create will be saved to this repo.

**Note:** Codes labeled as `(premium only)` will only work for Toyhouse users with a premium account. They do not designate a need to pay or donate to me.

## Organization
Each individual code and variation on that code is a single folder. Links below go to the listings on Toyhou.se. Feel free to download individually or grab the entire repo.
